ABSTRACT
  In the "BookHub" project, an easy-to-use, open-source website that facilitates
trouble-free eBook downloads is to be developed. In an era where digital content is
growing rapidly, the importance of having access to literature and information is
growing in modern technology. It will be simple for users to find books that fits with
their interests because they may search for eBooks by title, author, category, or
keyword. Users will be able to download eBooks in common formats such as PDF
and Docs for offline reading with just one click using the read and download
efficiency of the website. The purpose of this project is to provide a simple, legal
means for users to download eBooks for personal use and offline reading.
